scheduleTasks();

This code is written in Node.js and utilizes the 'node-cron' package to schedule tasks. It imports data from a file called 'ovrlapped-pairs.json', as well as a function called 'opportunity' from a module named 'opportunity'. The data is structured as an array of arrays, where each inner array contains two objects representing different decentralized exchange (DEX) pairs.

The processItem function is an asynchronous function that takes an inner array (containing two DEX pairs) as its argument. It then calls the opportunity function with these pairs and logs the response if it is undefined.

The main functionality of this code is to schedule tasks using the 'node-cron' package. The scheduleTasks function iterates through the data array and creates a cron job for each inner array (pair of DEX pairs). The cron job is scheduled to run every 5 seconds (*/5 * * * * *), and the processItem function is called with the current inner array as its argument.

Finally, the scheduleTasks function is called to start the cron jobs.
