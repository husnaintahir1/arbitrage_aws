This script is designed to identify arbitrage opportunities between Uniswap and Sushiswap decentralized exchanges. It imports the necessary packages, initializes Ethereum provider and signer, sets up the DEX routers, and defines trading pairs to monitor.

The script has three main functions: getAmountsOut, getAmountsOutFromPreviousPair, and opportunity. The first two functions interact with the smart contract's router methods, allowing the user to get the amount of tokens they will receive for a given input amount in a trade. The opportunity function compares the results of the first two functions to identify potential arbitrage opportunities.

The code calculates the difference in token amounts between the two exchanges and considers slippage and fees. If the difference is significant enough (greater than or equal to 0.1), an arbitrage opportunity is identified, and the script outputs information about the opportunity.

The script exports the opportunity function, which can be used in other parts of the application to find arbitrage opportunities between the specified trading pairs on Uniswap and Sushiswap.
