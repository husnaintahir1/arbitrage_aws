The file does the following:

Imports required dependencies, such as express, cors, web3, fs-extra, and axios.
Sets up an Express server and configures it to handle JSON and URL-encoded requests.
Defines an async function getPairs that retrieves token pairs and their liquidity information from the specified DEX by interacting with its smart contracts through Web3. The function also filters the results based on a minimum liquidity threshold.
Defines an async function getContractABI to fetch the contract ABI from Etherscan API.
Sets up an Express route /getPairsFor that fetches token pairs from both Uniswap and Sushiswap, groups them by their unique keys, and then writes the grouped data to a JSON file.
Sets up an Express route / that filters the token pairs, keeps only those that exist on both DEXes, and writes the resulting data to another JSON file.
Starts the Express server on the specified port.
When the /getPairsFor route is accessed, the application fetches token pairs and their liquidity information from Uniswap and Sushiswap, then combines and groups the pairs based on their unique keys. The results are written to a JSON file named data.json.

When the / route is accessed, the application filters the token pairs to keep only those that exist on both Uniswap and Sushiswap, then writes the results to another JSON file named ovrlapped-pairs.json.

Note that this application uses hard-coded contract addresses and ABIs for the Uniswap and Sushiswap factories. You should replace these with up-to-date values if needed.
